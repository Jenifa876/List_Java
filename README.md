# Java ArrayList and LinkedList Example

This program demonstrates the basic usage of `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` in Java. It covers operations such as adding, retrieving, updating, and removing elements from these list data structures.

## Program Features

1. **ArrayList Operations**:
   - Creates an `ArrayList` and populates it with integers from 0 to 9.
   - Prints the entire list.
   - Retrieves and prints the element at index `1`.
   - Updates the value at index `0` to `20` and prints the updated list.
   - Removes the element at index `0` and prints the final list.

2. **LinkedList Operations**:
   - Creates a `LinkedList` and adds two elements: `2` and `3`.
   - Prints the entire `LinkedList`.
   - Retrieves and prints the element at index `1`.
   - Retrieves and prints the first element in the `LinkedList`.

## Code Structure

- **ArrayList Section**:
- Demonstrates the dynamic resizing and ease of accessing elements by index.
- Covers basic operations like `add()`, `get()`, `set()`, and `remove()`.

- **LinkedList Section**:
- Highlights `LinkedList` as a doubly-linked list.
- Demonstrates basic operations like `add()`, `get()`, and `getFirst()`.

## Additional Notes

- **ArrayList**:
- Backed by a dynamically resizing array.
- Fast for random access but slower for insertion/removal operations (except at the end).

- **LinkedList**:
- Implemented as a doubly-linked list.
- Suitable for frequent insertion/deletion operations.
